This repository contains the Vin65 - Foundation framework work I've done. Some areas of the markup can be optimized should the platform integrate this work, to speed up load times, and prevent that "flash" of unstyled content.

Following core integration, this repository will then serve as a working model of the latest front-end of Vin65, for future development to talk place upon, templates to be forked from, etc.
